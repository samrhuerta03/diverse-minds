# imm2.0

Jen Comments: 
1. top button in page2.html is inside the box. 

SUGGESTIONS: 
- try centering the top button. I didn't even know it was at the corner. Also add a margin-top and margin-bottom to this top button so there's space between bottom browser page and the button.
- For page10.html, instead of having that entire link there add an a tag in the "HERE" word in "If you can not afford a lawyer. Click HERE to get a Free Lawyer!".
- for the creators page, center the contact button?
